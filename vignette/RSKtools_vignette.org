* Introduction
  <<sec:intro>>

RBR instruments output data in an open database format known as SQLite[fn:1]. To facilitate direct access to the data in Matlab[TM], we created the =RSKtools= toolbox. =RSKtools= facilitates direct access to the data stored in =RSK= files by using the included =mksqlite= library, for which we have provided versions compiled for Windows (32/64bit), Linux (64bit) and Mac OSX (64bit). It may be necessary to compile your own version, using the source code provided at http://sourceforge.net/projects/mksqlite/. 

=RSKtools= also provides some convenience functions for common data extraction (e.g. extracting profiles from a continuous dataset) and visualization (plotting individual profiles). For plans for future additions, see the [[sec:future][Future plans]] section.

* Installing
  <<sec:install>>

The latest stable version of =RSKtools= can be found at [[http://www.rbr-global.com/support/matlab-tools]].

  - Unzip the archive (to =~/matlab/RSKtools=, for instance)
  - Add the folder to your path inside matlab (=addpath ~/matlab/RSKtools= or some nifty GUI thing)
  - type =help RSKtools= to get an overview and take a look at the examples.

  
* Examples of use
  <<sec:examples>>
** Loading files

To work with an RSK file using =RSKtools=, a connection to the database must be made. This is done using the =RSKopen()= function. Note that =RSKopen= doesn't actually read the data, but reads a /thumbnail/ of the data which is typically about 4000 points long. The structure returned after opening an RSK looks something like:

#+begin_src matlab :results output :exports both
file = '../testfiles/065583_20140612_0739.rsk';
rsk = RSKopen(file)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example

                dbInfo: [1x1 struct]
              datasets: [1x1 struct]
    datasetDeployments: [1x1 struct]
          calibrations: [5x1 struct]
           instruments: [1x1 struct]
    instrumentChannels: [5x1 struct]
     instrumentSensors: []
              channels: [3x1 struct]
                epochs: [1x1 struct]
             schedules: [1x1 struct]

         thumbnailData: [1x1 struct]
              profiles: [1x1 struct]

#+end_example

Note the structure element called =thumbnailData=. In order to read the actual data, we use the =RSKreaddata()= function, which if given with one argument (the variable name of the RSK object) will read the entire data set. Because RSK files can store a large amount of data, it may be preferable to read a subset of the data, specified using a start and end time (in Matlab =datenum= format[fn:2]). 

#+begin_example
t1 = rsk.thumbnailData.tstamp(1) + 0.5; % half a day after start
t2 = rsk.thumbnailData.tstamp(1) + 1.5; % 1.5 days after start
rsk = RSKreaddata(rsk, t1, t2);
#+end_example

Note that the data structure can be found in the object at

#+begin_example
>> rsk.data        
ans = 
      tstamp: [442293x1 double]
      values: [442293x4 double]
    longName: {'Conductivity'  'Temperature'  'Pressure'  'Salinity'}
       units: {'mS/cm'  '?C'  'dbar'  'PSU'}
#+end_example

In this example, because the instrument was determined to be a "CTD"-type instrument, a new channel was created called =Salinity= (using the Practical Salinity Scale). The salinity calculation is performed by the [[http://teos-10.org/software.htm][TEOS-10]] package, which can be obtained from http://teos-10.org/software.htm.

** Working with profiles

Profiling loggers with recent versions of firmware contain the ability to automatically detect and log profile "events". These are denoted as "downcasts" and "upcasts", and the function =RSKreadprofiles()= can be used to extract individual profiles from the raw data, based on the previously identified events. Following this, quick plots of the profiles can be made using the =RSKplotprofiles()= function.

#+begin_src matlab :results file :exports both
file = '../testfiles/065583_20140612_0739.rsk';
rsk = RSKopen(file);

%% load the first 10 profiles
rsk = RSKreadprofiles(rsk, 1:10);

%% plot the downcasts
subplot(121)
RSKplotprofiles(rsk, [], 'temperature', 'down')
subplot(122)
RSKplotprofiles(rsk, [], 'salinity', 'down')

print -dpng profiles.png;
ans = 'profiles.png';
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:profiles.png]]


* Future plans
  <<sec:future>>

  - Cast detection for datasets without profile events
  - Wave processing functions
  - Improved data processing functions (e.g. for CTD data)
